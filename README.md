# Unity Package Cli
A simple tool to export unity packages from cli! I have no idea why unity does not support this having pipelines in the back of the head but here you go.


## Requirements
- .NET 7
- Python

## Currently working on
- Nested directories are currently not supported but will be soon


## How to use
Create a config using
cmd > UnityPackageCli.exe create-config

afterwards use the following command to create the packages.

UnityPackageCli.exe -create
